# StockTradingPlaform
This was a stock trading platform I had made for Harvard University's CS50 course on edx. It uses yahoo api to get current stock prices and it lets you buy, sell, and check prices for stock with a hidden surprise feature.

It's made using flask, sqlite, html, css, and Javascript.
